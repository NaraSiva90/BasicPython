# BasicPython
My exploration of concepts and examples from Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney.

This project / repository serves to document my efforts at learning the Python programming language and applying it successfully to solve quantitative finance / data science problems. 

## Motivation:
* Address the 2-language problem (prototyping in R, implementation in SAS / Java / C++) by learning this language which has limited capabilities of both. 
* Apply learnings from this book to Derivatives Analytics based on Mario Cerrato's book & Yves Hilpsch's book. 
* Attain at least interview-level proficiency in Python, expand my horizons and improve my employability at crack quant teams.
