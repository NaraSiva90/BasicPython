# BasicPython
My exploration of concepts and examples from Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney.

This project / repository serves to document my efforts at learning the Python programming language and applying it successfully to solve quantitative finance / data science problems. 

## Motivation:
* Address the 2-language problem (prototyping in R, implementation in SAS / Java / C++) by learning this language which has limited capabilities of both. 
* I also plan to apply the learnings from this book to Derivatives Analytics based on Cerrato's book.
